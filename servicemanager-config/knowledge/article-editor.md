# Article Editor
The options provided under the Article Editor settings give control over the toolbar options that are available on the article editor to all of the knowledge contributors.

Having a standard set of formatting options across all articles ensures that there is a consistent look and feel to articles.  The selection of options can be done to match or help conform to a style guide. An example of this might be to keep the Font Family turned off to make sure that all documents use the same font.

Removing unused options can also help simplify the toolbar, making it easier for people to work with the article formatting.
