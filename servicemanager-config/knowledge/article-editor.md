# Article Editor
The options provided under the Article Editor settings give control over the formatting options that are available on the article editor.

Having a standard set of formatting options across all articles ensures that there is a consistent look and feel to articles.  The selection of options can be done to match or help dictate a style guide. An example of this might be to keep the Font Family turned off to make sure that all documents use the same font.

Removing unused options can also help simplify the toolbar, making it easier for people to work with the article formatting.

The toolbar options are broken down into the following categories.

* Editor Options
* Font Options
* Formatting Options
* List Options
* Media Options
* Other Options

## Editor Options
* Undo
* Redo
* Hot Keys
* Fullscreen

The Editor Options sit on the right side of the toolbar, separate from the formatting options.
