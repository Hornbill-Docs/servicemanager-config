# Knowledge Tags
Tags can be used to help search for knowledge, identify trends, or possibly identify areas that might be lacking in information. The tag configuration lets you manage the tags that have been created and manage tags within your tag cloud.

You must have the Knowledge Administrator role to create tags. All Knowledge managers and contributors can then select from existing tags to attach to their articles.

## Cloud View
