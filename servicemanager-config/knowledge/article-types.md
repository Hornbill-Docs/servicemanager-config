# Article Types
Article types help categorize articles into distinct groups. They can be used for filtering, searching, or controlling some aspects of visibility.

When users create a new article, the article type is a mandatory field. For this reason, make sure to always have at least one article type that is active.

## Examples
When Service Manager is installed, it comes with seven examples of article types. These can be edited or removed as needed.

Each article type has the following attributes:
* Name
* Description
* Icon
* Status
