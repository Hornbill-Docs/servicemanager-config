# Profiles
Profiles provide hierarchical tree structures that you can use within different applications for applying profiles or categories.

## Profile List
The Profile List shows all of the existing profiles. Some of these profiles may have been automatically added through the installation of an application and are pre-configured and ready to be used by these applications.

## Adding
In the top right, clicking on the + (add) button will start the process to create a new profile

## Deleting
Using the check boxes next to the existing Profiles, select which ones you wish to delete and from the top button menu select Delete Selected. Be aware that these profiles may be in use by an application and deleting them may impact that application.

## Profile Details
By clicking on the name of any existing Profile, you will be taken to the Details page for that profile. From there you will be able to manage the Profile Tree and other settings.
