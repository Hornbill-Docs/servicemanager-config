# Relationships
The Service Manager Relationships allows you to define the different types of available relationships that can be used when linking different entities such as requests, services, assets, and more.

## Relationship Types
Relationship Types are defined terms that can be used for the creation of Relationship Links. When creating a Relationship Type consider the types of two way relationships that you would like to describe when liking two entities. As these will be used to create a relationship link, consider defining an opposite relationship type for each one created

### Translations
Create Relationship Types in any additionally required languages.

Open an existing Relationship Type, and use the Add Translation button to choose the language you you wish to create the translation for, and then either use the Translate option to use Google's Translate service to suggest a translation of the relationship type, or enter the translation in the Relationship Type field

### Edit
Change the display name of the Relationship Type by opening and editing the Relationship Type. Any changes will be inherited by any Relationship Links which are using the Relationship Type.

## Relationship Links
The Relationship Links lets you join or associate Relationship Types that will work together to describe the relationship between two entities.
