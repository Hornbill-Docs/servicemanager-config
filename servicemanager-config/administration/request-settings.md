# Request Settings
Use Request Settings to control the behavior of various features on Requests in Service Manager.

## On Hold Settings
Choose which request actions will be enabled when a request is placed on hold. By default, the following actions are enabled:

* Update
* Boards
* Cancel

Tick any actions that you wish to allow while requests are on hold, or remove the checkmark from those that you wish to disable. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

Revert any changes to the default settings by clicking **Reset**.

## Resolve Settings
Manage the Resolve settings to control the behavior when resolving requests.

* All manual Resolve/Close without an owner.
* Automatically mark SLM Resolution Timer as part of the resolve action. If using BPM to mark the resolution timer at times other than when resolving, this should be turned off.
* Enable the option to action on linked requests against a request through the Resolve tab.
* This will prevent a request from resolving if it has open activities.

## Customer Section

Choose which customer attributes will be displayed in the Customer Details section on request forms.

* Tick any attributes that you wish to display, or remove the checkmark from those that you wish to hide.
* Revert any changes to the default settings by clicking **Reset to default**.

A customer of a request can be either a user or a contact. As such, you can configure the attributes you wish to display depending on the type of customer of the request.
