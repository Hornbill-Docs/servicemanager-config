Use Request Settings to control the behavior of various features on Requests in Service Manager

## On Hold Settings
Choose which request actions will be enabled when a request is placed on hold, by default the following actions are enabled:

Tick any actions which you wish to allow whilst requests are on-hold, or un-tick those which you wish to disable. Use the Save option to apply the changes.

Revert any changes to the default settings by using the Reset option

## Resolve Settings
Manage the Resolve settings to control the behavior when resolving requests

* All manual Resolve / Close without an owner
* Automatically mark SLM Resolution Timer as part of the resolve action? If using BPM to mark the resolution timer at times other than when resolving this should be turned off
* Enable the option to action on linked requests against a request through the Resolve tab
* This will prevent a request from resolving if it has open activities
