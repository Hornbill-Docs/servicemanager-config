## Hornbill AI Fair Usage Policy

Usage of Hornbill AI can be tracked in the [Value Dashboard](/servicemanager-config/administration/hai-dashboard) show the number of requests plus counts on input and output tokens for the last 12 months. Currently there are no usage limits for Hornbill AI but Hornbill reserves the rights to enforce usage limits in the future, if usage limits were to be enforced a notification would be provided to all Hornbill AI Customers 30 days in advance of this change likely as part of a modification to the [Hornbill Artificial Intelligence Agreement](https://www.hornbill.com/hubfs/Website/PDF/HAI%20Agreement.pdf). Abnormal usage detected by our [SIEM process](/hornbill-cloud/iso/operations#security-information-and-event-management-siem) that would typically be caused by misuse and not by a typical user of Hornbill AI and would likely be triggered by an act that violates the [Hornbill AI Usage Policy](/servicemanager-config/administration/hai-usage-policy#hornbill-ai-usage-policy) would result in an alert to the primary contact of the instance.
