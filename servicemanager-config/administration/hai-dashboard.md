# HAi Dashboard

## Dashboard Access

The HAi Dashboard is available to any user associated with one of the following roles: 

|Role|Description|
|-|-|
|Service Desk Admin|This role is for a Service Desk Administrator. This includes, an elevated visibility to Requests and associated actions, the ability to configure Service Manager features via the Administration Tool and the option to restart a failed BPM within a Request.|

Additionally, any user with the application right **rightA.administerServiceDesk** can enable HAi features.

## Overview

The HAi Value Dashboard is designed to show you your organization's usage of HAi and estimate hours saved through generative AI (summarizing as generating text output). These calculations are estimates and are configurable. The top-line widgets show rolling 30-day usage and savings.

The first two line charts show the savings per month over the last 12 months. This will take a few weeks of usage before output is properly populated.

The second two charts show (1) Usage per day for the last 30 days by product area and (2) The top 4 most active users based on prompt usage over the last 30 days.
Currently, no additional filters can be applied to the dashboard.
