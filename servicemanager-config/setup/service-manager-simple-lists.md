# Simple Lists
The Simple Lists provide a way to define different pick lists or combo-box selections that are used through out the Service Manager app. The available options in a pick list or combo-box can also be translated into different languages from within the Simple List editor.

## Service Manager Simple Lists
A number of Simple Lists are installed with Service Manager.
