# Data Access Rules Help

Data access rules allow you to define a set of criteria that will restrict all AI processing against either a Request or a Knowledge Article, each have their own set or rules called a ```Rule Set```.

The rules are processed one at a time in order from the first down, if a rule is evaluated to true then access is restricted and AI will not be processed.
