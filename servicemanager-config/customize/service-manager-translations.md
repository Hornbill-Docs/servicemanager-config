# Translations
The Translation option provide the ability to translate individual strings of text into the language of your choice. Many of these strings can be translated through the user interface using [Translation Mode](/esp-config/internationalization/translation-mode), however this is not always the case and some strings must be translated here.

All the translation strings available here are related to the Service Manager application only.  Each Hornbill application has its own area for providing translations as well as the platform and portals.
* [Platform User Interface Translations](/esp-config/internationalization/user-interface-translations).
* [Customer Portal](/esp-config/customize/customer-portal-setup#translations)
* [Employee Portal](/esp-config/customize/employee-portal/employee-portal-configuration#translations)

## Accessing Service Manager Translations
1. Open Configuration or use [Ctrl+Shift+S] on the keyboard.
1. Type **Translations** in the search box.
1. In the results, select `Translations` under the Service Manager section.


## Filter
The filters work off of the translation key and the default translation. By typing in the the name of the key or the default translation, the list of translation strings will be narrowed down to the matching text.

## Translating
Under the Translated column you can see the translations which relate to the selected language in the tool bar. If a translation has not been provided it will show the default language of English (British). Clicking on any translation string in this column will open a translation box where you can do one of the following:

* Type your own translation in the text box and save
* Click on `Suggest` to do an automatic translation and save

:::tip
The `Suggest` option will only show if the selected language is different from the language set in your user profile.
