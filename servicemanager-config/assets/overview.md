# Asset management

::: note
This article is new, to support the preview release of the new Asset Management and its new UI. You can find documentation for the legacy UI [here](/servicemanager-user-guide/asset-management/overview-legacy-doc).
:::

Asset management involves the capturing and detailing of information for the assets within your organization. This includes tracking the ownership, costs, relationships, and life cycle of assets to support strategic decision-making for the IT environment.

Asset Management in Hornbill Service Manager gives you the flexibility to configure your implementation to best suit your organization's use case for managing asset records. You can record detailed hardware and software inventory information useful to IT when supporting the users of the assets, and when making decisions about purchases and redistribution.

The assets in Asset Management form the foundation of a Configuration Management Database (CMDB). Assets can be used as part of Incident, Problem, and Change processes to assist in incident classification, impact analysis, and change planning.

Asset categories allow you to group your asset types in a customizable way. Users navigate assets by category.
